<!--for some reason, if I stick the title in the title tag, it refuses to render on the site. Probably due to user error of some kind-->

<!--the html checker keeps saying this is a stray end tag, but I can't find a problem with it. Removing it
gets rid of the title-->
<!--As a note, I ran the site through an html validator, I fixed all the errors, with three notable exceptions.
You'll notice the lack of a <title> tag in both index and assignment01. That's because for whatever reason, htmls keeps disapearing everything in the title tags, for some reason. 
it also keeps saying the closing tag for the <head> element is a stray tag, despite the fact that removing it only breaks the site further. it also says that the opening tag 
for the <body> is unneeded as it was "already" open but removing it has a similar effect to removing the closing tag for <head>. This applies to both pages. -->
